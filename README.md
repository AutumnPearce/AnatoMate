AnatoMate
AnatoMate is an interactive anatomy learning website that includes a learning mode and a quiz mode to help users learn about human anatomy. The website consists of three main pages: the title screen (index.html), learning mode (learning_mode.html), and quiz mode (quiz_mode.html).

Title Screen (index.html)
The title screen is the homepage of the website. It displays the website's title, "AnatoMate", and an instruction to view the tutorial and start learning. Clicking on the instruction will navigate the user to the learning mode page (learning_mode.html).

Learning Mode (learning_mode.html)
The learning mode page displays an image of a labeled anatomy diagram. Users can click on the "Raise hand here to turn on labels" text in the navigation bar to toggle between the labeled image (label.png) and the unlabeled image (no_label.png).

On this page, there are two banners:

"Walk here to go back to menu!" - Clicking on this banner takes the user back to the title screen (index.html).
"Walk here to start 'Quiz' mode!" - Clicking on this banner takes the user to the quiz mode page (quiz_mode.html).
Quiz Mode (quiz_mode.html)
The quiz mode page presents users with True/False questions related to human anatomy. The question is displayed in the center of the page, and users can select their answers by clicking on the "True" or "False" options.

At the top-left corner of the page, there is an "exit-square" div with the text "Raise hand here to exit quiz mode". Clicking on this text takes the user back to the learning mode page (learning_mode.html).

To set up the website, download the source files and open the index.html file in a web browser. Users can navigate between pages by clicking on the appropriate text or banners.
